# Here we try to use the SVM Polynomail Kernel trick

  ### SVM is like Logistic Regression, but better in my opinion. Plus, you get to use amazing technique called the Kernel Trick. We are using the Polynomial Kernel trick here. The link to it's wikipedia page is below, check out. 
  ### We first construct a dataset that cannot be classified from linearly drawing a line between them on a 2d or 3d surfaces.
  ### So, we take squares of both the Independent Features and square them and plot them and them linearly classify them, easy...
